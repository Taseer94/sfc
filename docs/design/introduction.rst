Introduction
------------

.. NOTE::
   This is the working documentation for the SFC project.

The `OPNFV Service Function Chaining (SFC) <https://wiki.opnfv.org/sfc>`_ project aims to provide the ability to define
an ordered list of a network services (e.g. firewalls, NAT, QoS).
These service are then "stitched" together in the network to create a service chain.
This project provides the infrastructure to install the upstream ODL SFC implementation project in an NFV environment.
